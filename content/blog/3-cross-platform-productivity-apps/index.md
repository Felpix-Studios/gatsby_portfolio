description: We all love productivity apps! It's just that some work better than others, and on more than one device. Here's a list of 3 amazing apps that fit the bill (and pay for it too).

Everyone can appreciate a helpful productivity app. The problem is that not all of them can work across multiple devices; maybe it's between your phone and your laptop or two computers of different operating systems. Regardless, there still exists an incredible suite of tools that can function cross-platform, allowing you to integrate your life, workflow, and studying a little better. 

### üìù Todoist

Everyone wants a to do list. They're neat, practical tools that help you satisfyingly check off tasks that need to get done. But whereas Things 3 means you're out of luck as a Windows or Android user, [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) gets the job done. First of all, it's free. Then there's the fact that it's available on iOS, Android, has versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and also comes in clutch with a handy web platform. Sure, you can technically have to do lists in Notion, but that functionality isn't core to the user experience. For Todoist, that's kind of all it does.

### üìÖ Cron Calendar

A well organized calendar is the dream of planners who think ahead. Though there is of course Google Calendar, I like to get fancy with [Cron](https://cron.com/). I pretty much just use it as a better client for Google Calendar that also lets me schedule blocks of availability, the app's main selling point. Right now, it's in early access and you can get it by joining a waitlist or regularly checking their Twitter account. Unfortunatly, it is only for computers, no mobile apps out yet. Hopefully with Notion's acquisition of the company, they'll got on that soon!

### üìì Notion

Excellent foreshadowing strikes again. I can't talk about productivity without mentioning [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product), and it's  cross-platform abilities are really just an added bonus. It's a note-taking app, a database , and a kanban board all in one. Seriously, if there's one app to get from this list, it's Notion.
