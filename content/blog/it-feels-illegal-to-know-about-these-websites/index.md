This article is an adaptation of a [Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1555172960662585345.html) by Amy Pechacek. I might make more articles like this because the internet is such a massive space that there are always more websites to bookmark. Don’t worry, I’ve added a few lines here and there, and even put in some cool websites of my own.

# Axiom.Ai
No code automation.
